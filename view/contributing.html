                <p>Alice Vision relies on a friendly and community-driven effort to create an open source photogrammetry solution.</p>
                <p>
                The project strives to provide a <strong>pleasant</strong> environment for everybody and tries to be as <strong>non-hierarchical</strong> as possible. Every <strong>contributor</strong> is considered as a member of the team, regardless if they are a newcomer or a long time member. Nobody has <strong>special</strong> rights or prerogatives.
                <br/><br/>
                The contribution workflow relies on <a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">Github Pull Request</a>. We recommend to discuss new features before starting the development, to ensure that development is efficient for everybody and minimize the review burden.</p>
                <p>In order to foster a friendly and cooperative atmosphere where technical collaboration can flourish, we expect all members of the community to be
                <ul>
                    <li>courteous, polite and respectful in their treatment of others</li>
                    <li>helpful and constructive in suggestions and criticism</li>
                    <li>stay on topic for the communication medium that is being used</li>
                    <li>be tolerant of differences in opinion and mistakes that inevitably get made by everyone.</li>
                </ul>
